## Motivation
Nowadays, a buzzy request of any `telegram group` **owner/administrator** is to have a tool, which allows `detecting 
toxic (spamming/harming) group members`, leading to way more accurate and efficient `process of moderating the groups` to enchance EQ and grow social capital of the chat groups. 

Generally it is not only about filtering toxic people and toxic comments, it is about seeking mutual interests, and adding juce to communication, performing things like random coffe matching of persons potentially interesting for each other. Whois coffee bot is meant to encouraging people to leave their traditional circle of cummunication and learn new things.

Based on experience of [Rebels.AI](https://rebels.ai) in solving ML problems on daily bases, notably in NLP, 
strongly believe that solve substantial chatting-related problems, making the communication
more `ethical`, `secured`, `targeted` and in general, `wholesome` is a right thing to do.
