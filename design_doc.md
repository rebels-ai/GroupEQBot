Situation:

    2 types of output: 
        - events (manageable by interface) comes from group chats
        - validation events comes from ConversationHandler (private user:bot chats)
    We need interface for storing those events and reading them

    group chats
        users --> events
              --> validation events * adjust interface to skip them

    bot chats
        users --> validation events
              --> events * adjust interface to skip them

Tasks:

    * get one user's event from one group chat
    * get many user's event from one group chat

    * get one user's event from many group chats
    * get many user's event from many group chats

    * get one user's event from bot chat
    * get many user's event from bot chats

# Conceptual Solution for `GroupEvents` & `GroupUsers`

`Situation:`
There is group with certain amount of users. We would like to add bot to the group. (bot will have admin rights at that moment)

- Bot has to start registirng all the events and write those DB in `GroupEvents` Index.
- Bot gets the list of all the memberes in the group and write those in DB in `GroupUsers` Index
- Bot has to create entity in `BotMetadata` Index within the group information (PP)


```
telegram --> update (MyChatMember Update) --> router --> PublicEventProcessor --> 
    if self.internal_event.event_type == EventType.bot:  # bot was added into the group
        BackgroundUsersInitializer()  # Bot gets the list of all the memberes ...
        BackgroundBotMetadataInitializer()  # Bot has to create entity in `BotMetadata` ...


```









# Next 
* find get_chat_member
* does get_chat_members works for bots?


Functionality to glue indeces 
User can start validation if following are True:

    - Bot and user are in the same group chat (Implement BotMetaData Index)
        Questions:
            How to check in which groups bot is added and is admin?
            How to get list of all group members?
                We plan to use UserIndex
                Or bot methods if allowed
        Potential use cases:
        - User joined after bot was added to the group
        - User joined before the bot was added to the group

    - User hadn't started the validation
        Questions:
            How to check that user did not start the validation?
                We plan to use UserIndex
